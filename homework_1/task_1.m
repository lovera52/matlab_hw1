%a) Create a variable `radius` and assign it a value of 5.
%b) Calculate the area of a circle with this radius and store it in a variable called `area`.
%c) Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in a variable called `circumference`.
%d) Display the results with appropriate labels.

%VARIABLE OPERATIONS

%this is the raidus of the circle
radius = 5;
%this is what pi is equal to
pi = 3.14;
%this is the equation of area
area = pi * radius^2;
%this is the equation for circumference
circumference= 2*pi * radius;
